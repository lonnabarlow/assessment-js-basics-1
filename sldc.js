// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."; 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Requirement Analysis, also known as Requirement Engineering, is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified.";

const design = "Software Design is the process to transform the user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.";

const implementaiton = "Software implementation refers to the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow. ... Prior to implementation, the software should be selected by assessing needs, budget, potential benefits, obstacles, and so forth. Once the solution is chosen, implementation can begin.";

const testingAndIntegration = "Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.";
